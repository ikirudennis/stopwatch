h1. jQuery Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch plug-in for jQuery-supports multiple stopwatches per page.

I needed a simple stopwatch that would count up and at the press of a button, count down to zero and then count back up again.  It also keeps a log of how many times the reverse button has been pressed.
